# Model

* Drosophila melanogaster
* Mated
* 10 cohorts
* 520 individuals
    * 260 male
    * 260 female

# Workflow

![Workflow](/Users/Pikachu/Desktop/Proteome_stability_project/2018-06-25_workflow)

* One cohort per day
* 4 different treatments per day for all 13 lines
* 50/50 male and female based on cohort, strain, and treatment
* Position, sex, and treatment all randomized

# Cohort Setup
Keep 3 rearing vials and 1 "fresh" vial for replicates

* 1 old vial (backup)
* 1 middle vial (backup)
* 1 new vial (backup)
* 1 exp. vial
    * dump the adults and wait for newly eclosed adults
    * flip newly eclosed adults into fresh vial consecutive days
    * keep fresh vials for 5 days before using for tests

# Measure

1. Knockdown times
    * based on [thermal assay protocol here](https://adnguyen.github.io/Hahn_lab_protocols/2018-06-14_HC_Thermal_Hardiness_Assays_in_D_melanogaster.html)
2. Survivorship
    * after flies knockdown, move them into 5mL plastic tubes with food
    * monitor every day for individual fly death
